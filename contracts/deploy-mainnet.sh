Award NFT rewards to winners and active users to encourage participation. - Demonstration of NEAR to Non-Blockchain Communities:      - Strengthen partnerships through Twitter and Telegram.      - Host online events on Telegram and YouTube to showcase NEAR'\''s applications to non-blockchain audiences. Additionally, host training events to guide new users on how to use NEAR Dapps.  We commit to maintaining a consistent presence on our social media channels, updating the community on NEAR Protocol'\''s latest developments, news, and opportunities. Through these direct initiatives, we aim to actively contribute to the growth and adoption of NEAR in the Spanish-speaking community.  ### Scope  As more than 80% of the content available on Near is in English, we have taken a deliberate step towards sharing information with the global Spanish-speaking community in their native language. We aim to educate and equip Spanish-speaking communities by creating informative resources that can be utilized to encourage interaction and engagement.   ### Our Team  |Activity|Member| | --- | --- | ||| |Project Manager:|[Ulises Marin](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=ramgor.near)| |Telegram group moderators:| [Yaneisia Hernandez](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=yaneisia.near), [Julián Mostacero](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=biolmoon.near), [Gilberth Betancourt](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=gilberth.near) | |Twitter:|[Milly Rodriguez](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=millyrodriguez.near)| | Content Curator, Video creator/ Near Social / BOS, Medium |[América Castro](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=cripteros.near) | |Content Creators, AMAs, Workshops, Relations, and Collaborators:| [Fritz Wagner](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=fritzwagner.near), [Alejandro Moreno](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=almore.near) , [Francisco John](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=nearmultiverse.near) [Angel Sanchez](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=skyempire.near)| |||  ### Goals  Our project is driven by clear and ambitious goals that align with our mission to educate, onboard new users, and build a vibrant Spanish-speaking community around NEAR Protocol, its ecosystem, and BOS for grassroots users.

Vision: Create a self-sustaining blockchain ecosystem within the community.  Core Programs: Educational initiatives, community engagement events, and technical development projects.        Problem Aimed to Solve: Lack of blockchain literacy and engagement within the community even though there is a lot of interest and a legal framework to support this interest.        Alignment with NDC Priorities: Our focus on education, community engagement, and technical development directly contributes to NDC'\''s goals of fostering blockchain knowledge and application.   ### Roadmaps :  - Technical Roadmap: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15IUHXsTtDwxAO-IaqVv7fZZhH5u7bwl8KYlZVK9Lo-E/edit?usp=sharing  - Social  Media Strategy: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r7j4Ug1GlvkHJnRIiLLMf3A8RCnNvCh5aBHVUEG4RCM/edit?usp=sharing       - Onboarding Roadmap: https://hackmd.io/@OYvbC8HsQAq3juRV_SWTVQ/SJ0J_alkC  ### Milestones/KPIs: - Community Engagement Metrics: Aim to increase Telegram group activity to at least 25 active members and achieve 5k impressions on X. To achieve 5k impressions on X, starting from 399, an increase of 1,153% is required through more frequent posts/interactions. - Educational Outreach: Plan to publish 2 educational articles each month and the team will produce 2 videos each month from team, community, and student meetup events.  Wallet Creation and Transaction Targets: To enhance NEAR Protocol adoption among local residents, the objective is to create 25-50 new NEAR wallets monthly, engaging 10-20 students and 10-20+ community members through educational and practical activities. The initiative aims for an average of 3-5 transactions per new wallet, demonstrating the protocol'\''s real-world applications.   ## Section 8. Budget Team Support: $390 (30% of Globe DAO total)  Community Initiatives: $910 (after team allocation) - BTC Pizza Day Event: $500 (swag + onboarding) - Content Creation: $150 (Blogs/Articles and Videos, each $75) - Marketing: $110 - Event Refreshments: $150     Commitment Length: Ongoing, with key milestones reviewed quarterly.   Full Remuneration from Budget: No, the budget covers team, community marketing, and education support, but there is additional funding from [Pizza DAO](https://twitter.com/Pizza_DAO) for the Bitcoin Pizza Day event.  ## Section 9. Project/DAO Longevity Funding Requirement: Continuous funding, with poposals reviewed monthly in the form of retrospectives. The goal is to be self-sufficient by Q1 2025.  Sustainability Plan: Generate revenue through project developments, partnerships, and community contributions. With an eventual [digital assets license](https://laws.gov.ag/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ANTIGUA-AND-BARBUDA-DIGITAL-ASSET-BUSINESS-BILL-2020-S3S3-PV.pdf), Near Antigua should be efficiently poised to earn fees from businesses that utilize the license services (PoS for small businesses).

I am writing to propose an initiative that aligns with the funding focus for NEAR Grassroots DAOs, particularly aimed at Widening Adoption of NEAR and outreach to new audiences. Our proposal involves the creation of a Swahili Web3 Podcast, designed to educate and engage the Swahili-speaking communities about NEAR Protocol and the possibilities of Web3 technology.  # Project Overview:  We believe langunage is the best medium of adoption and as we embark in this journey as it signfies in our chosen name for the podcast : ****NEAR Safiri - a swahili word most common and known to symbolize the journey we want to embark. Our main objectives to onboard swahili speaking communities into the digital economy of NEAR through education and engagement leveraging the podcast medium as a powerful tool for outreach.  # Key Components:  ****Podcast Series: Develop and produce a series of Swahili-language podcast episodes that cover a range of topics related to NEAR Protocol, blockchain technology, decentralized applications (dApps), and the broader Web3 ecosystem.  ****Guest Interviews: Invite key figures, experts, and community leaders from the NEAR ecosystem to share insights and knowledge, enhancing the educational value of the podcast.  ****Audience Engagement: Implement gamification mechanics, such as leaderboards or challenges, to encourage listener participation and interaction with the NEAR Protocol. Create referral systems to incentivize the audience to bring in new members.  ****Promotion and Marketing: Utilize various channels, including social media, to promote the podcast and attract a wider audience. Collaborate with influencers and creators within the Swahili-speaking communities to amplify the outreach efforts.  # Budget: Podcast Production and Hosting - 700$ Guest Outreach and Compensation - 200$ Marketing and Promotion - 300$ Gamification Mechanics Development - 200$  # **Metrics:  **User Retention:   We aim for a retention rate of 10-20 after 1 week, and 10-20% of that after 2 weeks, and 5-10% after 4 weeks.  **Account Acquisition Cost:   We target an acquisition cost of $1-$5 per new listener/account, depending on marketing efforts and outreach strategies.  **dApps Usage:   Encourage listeners to engage with 1-2 dApps related to NEAR Protocol. Aim for a median usage of 1-2 dApps per retained listener after 1 week.  **Engagement in Social Media:   we aim for an Average Engagement Rate (AER) of 2-5% on social media platforms, including likes, shares, comments, and other interactions with podcast content.  We believe that a Swahili Web3 Podcast can effectively contribute to NEAR'\''s grassroots efforts by reaching new audiences and fostering community engagement. We look forward to the opportunity to discuss this proposal further and contribute to the growth of the NEAR ecosystem. https://twitter.com/KamusiYaWeb3  ", "attachments":[], "labels":["nearafrica","near-swahili","near-education","new-communities","african-resources"], "metrics":{}, "reports":[], "requested_amount": 1400, "post_type": "Proposal", "proposal_version": "V1"}}' --deposit 0.01 --accountId "$ACCOUNT_ID"

Mental Maze is a Create, Play, and challenge to earn Puzzle gaming Protocol. Mental Maze utilizes web2 & web3 technology to achieve decentralization, scalability, security and transparency. Mental Maze is a cutting-edge web3 gaming company revolutionising the gaming industry.  Mental Maze is a create, challenge and play-to-earn gaming ecosystem built on Aurora.   Our GitHub is not open source at this moment as we are still in development. However, we can open or invite key stakeholders to have a look.    ## About Mental Maze: Mental Maze is a web3 game designed with a combination of mind-challenging puzzles and a corresponding reward system, built on blockchain NFT technology. Players will therefore be expected to scale different puzzle levels to earn rewards based on their speed and accuracy. The rewards surpass the stress by far, not to mention the awesome adventurous experience  ## Our Success so far After Launching V1 mainnet in early February, Mental Maze has become one of the leading dApps on Aurora for weeks. This can be seen on dApp radar.  https://dappradar.com/dapp/mental-maze    ## State of the Project.   With low resources and few hands, we have seen a level of progress. However, according to our roadmap, we have major updates to run fast on. In order to raise the gaming bar on Mental Maze, we added two major features to be built in the period of one month. They are; Community Squad and Maze tournaments.  Attached are links to all our Figma files for verification.   https://www.figma.com/file/VVeVAxyoR2Ey7UdTPxwJkM?type=design  https://www.figma.com/file/flPr3cc5HnMfx617YV6oTt?type=design  ## What Support is Needed?  Having said all above, we need to expand our technical team to be able to give us speed and accuracy as we develop our product in this stage and also launch the mainnet on NEAR Protocol. Why launch on NEAR? To enable NEAR users to tap the gaming experience on Mental Maze and also onboard more off-chain users into NEAR.  Also, to further widen our outreach via marketing.   ## Funds Needed To achieve our desired goals, a one-time sum of $20,000 is needed. The breakdown is as below.  Hire one back-end developer on contract for three months for $4500 ($1500 monthly) Hire one front-end developer on contract for three months $3000 ($1000 monthly) Hire a RUST dev on contract for two months. $6000 ($2000 monthly)  Product marketing $6500 (Partnerships, influencer marketing, community activities, IRL events, etc)   ## Project Delivery Based on receiving this amount, Mental Maze is set to become self-sustaining and deliver the following  ### Milestone 1 Community Squad and Maze tournaments by the Last week of April  The Community Squad is our chat platform. This enables gamers to have groups where they interact and play games that are exclusive to their community alone.   The Maze tournaments are puzzle games that are intended to boost the curiosity of members. The tournament reshapes the Mental Maze platform as it introduces other puzzle games such as Jigsaws. They will consist of inter-community tournaments and individual tournaments.  ### Milestone 2 Launch on NEAR Mainnet by the Second week of May.  This is to enable us to launch the entire Mental Maze smart contract on NEAR to widen our scope of reach.   ### Milestone 3 V2 Mainnet Launch 	The v2 Mainnet is the puzzle launchpad. This will provide the full ability for people to create different kinds of puzzles on Mental Maze without having to put any codes together.   ## How will NEAR/NDC benefit from Mental Maze?  Upon the delivery of our milestones, the following are the fully expected outcomes.  	1.Onboard between 5k-15k users by the end of Q2 live on Aurora and NEAR mainnet  	2.Retain 80% of onboarded users 	3.Delivered 20k+ transactions on chain monthly both on NEAR and Aurora  	 	 	# Full Proposal with images found here.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/12MOEO2KgPfEkkBwCFEPguBa4lRRQ4rU2gJChCHGJTLs/edit    Current Team   Igboze Israel  		                Team Lead  Ajemark         	            	   Back-end/Solidity Dev Shola                                      Front-end Dev Jesumuyiwa Grace    	     UI/UX designer  Ijaola Omotola           	      Game creator  Juliet                          	        Content writer      Connect with Us: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/official_mmaze?s=21&t=meAljIy1rKjh6LjNVYwIFQ)  [Telegram](https://t.me/official_mentalmaze) [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/8STEwMEu) [Near](https://near.social/#/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=mentalmaze.near) [Medium](https://medium.com/@mentalmaze) [Website](https://www.mentalmaze.io/)    #### Wallet ID: mentalmaze.near  Telegram: @israel_igboze  Email: igboze@mentalmaze.io     ", "attachments":[], "labels":["hom","mental-maze","project-development","games"], "metrics":{}, "reports":[], "requested_amount": 20000, "post_type": "Proposal", "proposal_version": "V1"}}' --deposit 0.01 --accountId "$ACCOUNT_ID"

Mental Maze is a Create, Play, and challenge to earn Puzzle gaming Protocol. Mental Maze utilizes web2 & web3 technology to achieve decentralization, scalability, security and transparency. Mental Maze is a cutting-edge web3 gaming company revolutionising the gaming industry.  Mental Maze is a create, challenge and play-to-earn gaming ecosystem built on Aurora.   Our GitHub is not open source at this moment as we are still in development. However, we can open or invite key stakeholders to have a look.    ## About Mental Maze: Mental Maze is a web3 game designed with a combination of mind-challenging puzzles and a corresponding reward system, built on blockchain NFT technology. Players will therefore be expected to scale different puzzle levels to earn rewards based on their speed and accuracy. The rewards surpass the stress by far, not to mention the awesome adventurous experience  ## Our Success so far After Launching V1 mainnet in early February, Mental Maze has become one of the leading dApps on Aurora for weeks. This can be seen on dApp radar.  https://dappradar.com/dapp/mental-maze    ## State of the Project.   With low resources and few hands, we have seen a level of progress. However, according to our roadmap, we have major updates to run fast on. In order to raise the gaming bar on Mental Maze, we added two major features to be built in the period of one month. They are; Community Squad and Maze tournaments.  Attached are links to all our Figma files for verification.   https://www.figma.com/file/VVeVAxyoR2Ey7UdTPxwJkM?type=design  https://www.figma.com/file/flPr3cc5HnMfx617YV6oTt?type=design  ## What Support is Needed?  Having said all above, we need to expand our technical team to be able to give us speed and accuracy as we develop our product in this stage and also launch the mainnet on NEAR Protocol. Why launch on NEAR? To enable NEAR users to tap the gaming experience on Mental Maze and also onboard more off-chain users into NEAR.  Also, to further widen our outreach via marketing.   ## Funds Needed To achieve our desired goals, a one-time sum of $20,000 is needed. The breakdown is as below.  Hire one back-end developer on contract for three months for $4500 ($1500 monthly) Hire one front-end developer on contract for three months $3000 ($1000 monthly) Hire a RUST dev on contract for two months. $6000 ($2000 monthly)  Product marketing $6500 (Partnerships, influencer marketing, community activities, IRL events, etc)   ## Project Delivery Based on receiving this amount, Mental Maze is set to become self-sustaining and deliver the following  ### Milestone 1 Community Squad and Maze tournaments by the Last week of April  The Community Squad is our chat platform. This enables gamers to have groups where they interact and play games that are exclusive to their community alone.   The Maze tournaments are puzzle games that are intended to boost the curiosity of members. The tournament reshapes the Mental Maze platform as it introduces other puzzle games such as Jigsaws. They will consist of inter-community tournaments and individual tournaments.  ### Milestone 2 Launch on NEAR Mainnet by the Second week of May.  This is to enable us to launch the entire Mental Maze smart contract on NEAR to widen our scope of reach.   ### Milestone 3 V2 Mainnet Launch 	The v2 Mainnet is the puzzle launchpad. This will provide the full ability for people to create different kinds of puzzles on Mental Maze without having to put any codes together.   ## How will NEAR/NDC benefit from Mental Maze?  Upon the delivery of our milestones, the following are the fully expected outcomes.  	1.Onboard between 5k-15k users by the end of Q2 live on Aurora and NEAR mainnet  	2.Retain 80% of onboarded users 	3.Delivered 20k+ transactions on chain monthly both on NEAR and Aurora  	 	 	# Full Proposal with images found here.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/12MOEO2KgPfEkkBwCFEPguBa4lRRQ4rU2gJChCHGJTLs/edit    Current Team   Igboze Israel  		                Team Lead  Ajemark         	            	   Back-end/Solidity Dev Shola                                      Front-end Dev Jesumuyiwa Grace    	     UI/UX designer  Ijaola Omotola           	      Game creator  Juliet                          	        Content writer      Connect with Us: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/official_mmaze?s=21&t=meAljIy1rKjh6LjNVYwIFQ)  [Telegram](https://t.me/official_mentalmaze) [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/8STEwMEu) [Near](https://near.social/#/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=mentalmaze.near) [Medium](https://medium.com/@mentalmaze) [Website](https://www.mentalmaze.io/)    #### Wallet ID: mentalmaze.near  Telegram: @israel_igboze  Email: igboze@mentalmaze.io     ", "attachments":[], "labels":["hom","mental-maze","project-development","games"], "metrics":{}, "reports":[], "requested_amount": 20000, "post_type": "Proposal", "proposal_version": "V1"}}' --deposit 0.01 --accountId "$ACCOUNT_ID"

DAO/Project Charter/Goals  **Mission:** GLOA unites global creatives & technologists, to push boundaries of ingenuity and societal impact, through arts, collaboration & experimentation.  **Vision:** To bring the world together peacefully through the inspiration of arts, responsible tech, and riveting shared experiences.  **Core programs:** We run parallel yet complementary tracks, related to arts & technology. On the event & festival side, we offer opportunities to artists for showcases - through live/hybrid events, studio sessions and video, encouraging artists to push imagination through experimentation. We run workshops and clinics on web3 fundamentals, such as wallet creation, crypto/blockchain safety, and generative AI minted as NFTs. We are devising tangible solutions for creatives, communities & volunteers to self-seed their projects, and mastermind DAO-led bounties that support non-profits and volunteers in developing regions (e.g. our Malawi project).  **How they align with NDC:** Increasing quality NEAR wallet activations and MAA. Integrating NEAR wallet access and issuing dynamic NFT tickets required to enter our regular live & hybrid events, including post-event HD recordings of artistic performances, and accessible in custom, token-gated VR spaces. Building and improving upon core NEAR technologies. We need to build a system to help us run these things, to progress from manual trialing, MVP, and prototype into indispensable, everyday tool. Global, broad promotion & knowledge dissemination of NEAR. We have been NEAR proponents from our outset, crafting introductory videos and facilitating NFT minting workshops on Mintbase. Our 3-year roadmap reaches completely around the world, to sophisticated creative & arts-tech communities in a plethora of regions and cultures. We are particularly appreciative of NEAR because of its history of supporting the arts & creative projects.  Team: **Sea Ansley, Samarth Jairaman, Jarred Taylor, Noble Luke, Valencia Selestina, Sara Sush** Budget requested: **$3200 (Tier C)**  **What Problem Are You Aiming to Solve?** Exciting people about learning and harnessing the potential of emerging tech. Improving accessibility & dissemination of knowledge and content to engaged audiences, through simplistic onboarding and incentivising ongoing interaction.  AI Dragon has multiple objectives:  * Exploring how dynamic NFTs (tokens, tickets and keys) can underpin & elevate events production, audience engagement/retention, participant rewards * Open Education & Knowledge access, including ahead of events (warming up audiences and additional promotional mechanism) * Masterminding deFi-led methods for events teams and small communities to self-seed & resource their projects (intercorrelated with DAO, tokens & NFTs) * To simplify onboarding authentic individuals & participants in new, safe and secure ways * Making wallets indispensable in the operations of a fluid system/platform, and ensuring regular, authentic wallet/on-chain activity * Following on the efforts of Robots & Animals, to inspire and spread the imperative need for responsible programming to founders & devs, particularly with AI, MLM, blockchain and * Improving the quality and performance of tech-focused events, and improving stakeholders’ benefits / satisfaction.  **How can your DAO / Project achieve NDC priorities, goals, and KPIs?** This project strives to integrate NEAR technologies with the running, execution, attendance and accessibility of events and communities. Dynamic NFT tickets gate access to live/hybrid events, while inviting ticketholders back to enjoy post-event HD recordings of artistic performances, and accessible in custom, token-gated VR spaces.  **Wallet and on-chain interactions will occur upon numerous milestones that are designed to increase in frequency:**  * Registration for the event / tickets (receive NFT as ticket) * Entering the event (NFT ticket verification / claim, can also receive Proof of Attendance) * Perks and interactions within the event/festival itself (a key study component of our AI Dragon trials & surveys). For instance, in-house food/drink, merch, dancefloor rewards, costume prizes, (no) talent contests, quiz shows, games, etc. * Crew & Artist payment and rewards, if applicable. Increasing events offer tokens to event participants, lowering financial risk while fairly rewarding team members upon success * Post-event, gated access to HD media captured (performances, DJ sets, videos, documentaries, photographs, artwork, stories, etc). This media could be periodically rolled out, such as a weekly episode of sets from a festival, that could last for weeks or months. * An award or early invitation to the next event (in our study, it will be the AI Dragon Showcase event - Milestone 3) * Wallet interactions within the supplementary finale event (see point 3, but of a more digital nature.)  **Building and improving upon core NEAR technologies.** A simpler and more secure means of onboarding masses of people to “web3” is imperative. Improved means of tracking referrals - for instance, wallets that originated in the GLOA community, and from which individual (if any). Specific to AI Dragon, we are hoping to mock up a platform that automates and simplifies the workload of planning, producing, promoting & financing festivals, events and creative projects.  **Leveraging NEAR technologies to greater societal benefit.** NEAR tech could play a vital role in our efforts to implement autonomous deFi systems that fund & educate social impact groups, non-profit communities and volunteers. For instance, fundraising for Malawi. A combination of DAO and deFi can protect donor funds by ensuring contributions are matched with verifiable action. AI assistants could radically transform equal access to information (and language translation), particularly useful for poor and under-educated populaces who have been historically underserved.  **Promoting NEAR around the world.** We have over two decades of experience producing exciting and original events. We’ve previously brought NEAR to our events Nepal, Malaysia, Thailand and India. Our roadmap spreads across the world in the coming years, with our next stop to return and grow our Thailand audience in May 2024.  ## Roadmap of your DAO/project, Milestones, and achievements  ### 2024  **April 2024 - Goa / India** First A.I.Dragon prototype series in Goa Workshops and focus groups based around: 1) wallet interactions; 2) open knowledge recordings; 3) Specific development solutions NFT ticket = access to live/VR spaces, post-event media  **Q2 2024 - Thailand / South East Asia** Several trial web3/arts networking events and workshop groups.

If NEAR feels it’s important to offer a selection of high quality, eco-friendly merchandise, we can explore local manufacturing in Thailand * Detailed budgets and breakdowns will be shared upon each Milestone’s report  ### Section 9. Project/DAO longevity  Does your project/DAO require one-time or continuous funding? **One-time** Will your DAO/Project device way of sustaining itself after this round of funding? **Ideally. We will continue to self-fund as necessary, while assessing the viability to progress our Dev funding tracks** What are the possible roadblocks to the success of your project/DAO? **Technological issues that complicate our ambitions.** For example, to correlate NFTs with virtual/live tickets & access, or even simpler wallet onboarding/usage, or systems are too slow and buggy. Otherwise, at this point, the DAO and project are strong, and on a solid upwards trajectory.

Simultaneously, we'\''re preparing for cohort 3 as well as working towards launching a specialized \"102\" course tailored for individuals seeking to delve deeper into technical aspects, thus advancing their research capabilities. We'\''ll also continue accepting research proposals from the community.  Investing in our educational initiatives aims to cultivate a vibrant ecosystem of researchers and innovators dedicated to advancing blockchain technology in the NEAR ecosystem and beyond.    ## Links  [NRC March 2024 Report](https://gov.near.org/t/report-near-research-collective-march-2024/38821)  [April 2024 Proposal to HOM](https://gov.near.org/t/approved-by-house-of-merit-didnt-pay-near-research-collective-april-2024/38372)  [Charter](https://arweave.net/B5CZYUbg9qKN4kEFCr5qCvSBgszrTK8udEmHsEPPH2c)  [NCR BOS Course Page](https://near.social/research-collective.near/widget/NCR.v1) | [Web 2 Course Page](https://marmaj.org/NCR/)  [DAO Page](https://research-collective.near.social/)   [Telegram](https://t.me/ResearchWG)  [Twitter / X](https://twitter.com/ResearchWG)  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ResearchWG)  ## Achievements / Objectives  Although the NRC is relatively new, we have achieved significant milestones:  - Enlisted six guest lecturers for the first 12-week NCR course. - Collaborated with [Meta Pool DAO](https://www.metapool.app/ambassadorvote/vote/10) to produce 3 articles by our researchers. - Directed 3 researchers to the [Technical Speakers Program](https://nearfoundation.typeform.com/TSPEoI) (TSP). - Hired and trained 2 co-facilitators [Nedlar](https://near.social/near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=15870c8972a9fe6cdb7dfc2df835740108e8674cc170a091cd0ece0b9e4f6cfa), and [BGem](https://near.social/near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=bheegem.near) to assist with the set-up and running of NCR course. - Collected 7 student Final project NFT'\''s on the DAO from cohort 1 of the NCR course. - Onboarded a qualified individual to be a lead facilitator in the future. - Started accepting research proposals for alumni of the NCR course, there are 3 approved proposals that should yield valuable research papers in the near future. - More than doubled the number of students active in cohort 2 vs cohort 1 of the NCR course (23 active students).

The Turkish lira’s volatility and rising inflation seen in recent months has led our investors / crypto enthuasists / developers to see cryptocurrency as a profitable investment in the long term and as a hedge against inflation in the short term. Unfortunately, little English is spoken in Turkish-speaking countries and members cannot follow the latest updates on NEAR and misunderstand some topics. It’s hard for the community to express themselves in English. As mentioned above, we have been representing NEAR in Türkiye since March 2021 and continue our support in good times and bad.  ### KPIs and Goals   1. **Accounts retention after 1/2/4/8 weeks and Social engagement score** aim to retain at least 50% onboarded accounts  We will continue sharing daily content in all our social media accounts, get in touch with different crypto communities and give support 7/24.
